## Bug fixes

* Fix possible compilation error for [`json`](../../models-and-databases/reference/fields.md#json) fields defined without additional options.
* Fix incorrect operations created when generating [migrations](../../models-and-databases/migrations.md) for models in which multiple columns were renamed.
* Make sure that the strings that are translated in templates (when using the [`translate`](../../templates/reference/tags.md#translate) tag) are automatically escaped (see [Auto-escaping](../../templates/introduction.md#auto-escaping)).
