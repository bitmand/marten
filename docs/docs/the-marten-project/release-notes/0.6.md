## New features

### Minor features

#### Handlers and HTTP

* [Session stores](../../handlers-and-http/sessions.md) now make it possible to easily configure when session entries expire through the use of the [`#expires_at=`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/HTTP/Session/Store/Base.html#expires_at%3D(value%3ATime)-instance-method), [`#expires_at_browser_close=`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/HTTP/Session/Store/Base.html#expires_at_browser_close%3D(value%3ABool)-instance-method), and [`#expires_in=`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/HTTP/Session/Store/Base.html#expires_in%3D(value%3ATime%3A%3ASpan)-instance-method) methods. Please refer to [Customizing session expiry times](../../handlers-and-http/sessions.md#customizing-session-expiry-times) to learn more about this capability.
* An alias for the [`#reverse`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/Handlers/Base.html#reverse(*args%2C**options)-instance-method) handler method ([`#url`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/Handlers/Base.html#url(name%3AString|Symbol%2C**kwargs)%3AString-instance-method)) was introduced.
* A [Referrer-Policy middleware](../../handlers-and-http/reference/middlewares.md#referrer-policy-middleware) was introduced to make it possible to automatically set the Referrer-Policy header in responses generated by handlers.

#### Templates

* An alias for the [`#url`](../../templates/reference/tags.md#url) template tag ([`#reverse`](../../templates/reference/tags.md#reverse)) was introduced.

#### Development

* A new `--log-level` command option was introduced to make it easier to configure the log level to use when running [management commands](../../development/management-commands.md) (see [Shared options](../../development/management-commands.md#shared-options) for more details).
* The [`new`](../../development/reference/management-commands.md#new) management command now makes it possible to generate projects without configured databases when the `--database=none` option is used.
